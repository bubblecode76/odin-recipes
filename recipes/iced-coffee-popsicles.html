             <ol>
                <li>Add the coconut milk, coffee and honey into a saucepan. Heat the ingredients over medium high heat while stirring, to dissolve the honey and bring the coconut milk to a simmer.</li>
                <li>Remove the saucepan from the heat and allow the coffee to be infused with the coconut milk - about 15 minutes.</li>
                <li>In a small bowl, place the water and sprinkle the gelatin over the surface. Allow the gelatin to bloom in the water, for at least 10 minutes (until the coffee has infused the coconut milk).</li>
                <li>Pour the coffee coconut milk through a fine sieve to remove coffee grounds. You should have just over 3 cups of coffee coconut milk. Taste the coffee milk and add more honey or sweetener to taste (remember the coffee popsicles will taste less sweet once they are frozen).</li>
                <li>While the coffee milk is still hot, add the bloomed gelatin and stir until the gelatin is completely dissolved.</li>
                <li>Pour the mixture into popsicles molds - about 10 x 3 oz popsicles. Allow the liquid to cool down slightly.</li>
                <li>If your popsicle molds come with the sticks attached to the popsicle "lid", then simply cover your popsicles with the lids and transfer the popsicles into the freezer for at least 4 - 5 hours to completely harden (the time will depend on your freezer temperature).</li>
                <li>If you have popsicle molds where you require the popsicle sticks to be inserted directly into the popsicles, then place the filled molds in the freezer for about 15-20 minutes to thicken slightly, and then insert the popsicle sticks. Transfer the popsicles into the freezer for another least 4 - 5 hours to completely harden (the time will depend on your freezer temperature).</li>
             </ol>
